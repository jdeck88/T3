Abstract

Marine molluscs represent an estimated 23% of all extant marine taxa, but research into their conservation status has so far
failed to reflect this importance, with minimal inclusion on the authoritative Red List of the International Union for the
Conservation of Nature (IUCN). We assessed the status of all 632 valid species of the tropical marine gastropod mollusc,
Conus (cone snails), using Red List standards and procedures to lay the groundwork for future decadal monitoring, one of
the ﬁrst fully comprehensive global assessments of a marine taxon. Three—quarters (75.6%) of species were not currently
considered at risk of extinction owing to their wide distribution and perceived abundance. However, 6.5% were considered
threatened with extinction with a further 4.1% near threatened. Data deficiency prevented 13.8% of species from being
categorised although they also possess characteristics that signal concern. Where hotspots of endemism occur, most
notably in the Eastern Atlantic, 42.9% of the 98 species from that biogeographical region were classified as threatened or
near threatened with extinction. All 14 species included in the highest categories of Critically Endangered and Endangered
are endemic to either Cape Verde or Senegal, with each of the three Critically Endangered species restricted to single islands
in Cape Verde. Threats to all these species are driven by habitat loss and anthropogenic disturbance, in particular from
urban pollution, tourism and coastal development. Our findings show that levels of extinction risk to which cone snails are
exposed are of a similar magnitude to those seen in many fully assessed terrestrial taxa. The widely held view that marine
species are less at risk is not upheld.

Introduction Cone snails of the genus Conus offer an excellent opportunity to
explore global threats to marine molluscs owing to their
exceptional diversity [10], wide distribution, high degree of
endemism, varied depth distribution [11], and an established
global market in their trade from amateur shell collectors to
commercial traders [12]. In addition, cone snails are used in some
communities in the Paciﬁc as an occasional foodstuff [13] but,
more importantly, they are actively targeted by international drug
companies and researchers as a potential pharmacological
resource [14].

Cone snails constitute the family Conidae, which together with
the Tum'dae (turrid snails) and Terebridae (auger snails) comprise the
superfamily Conoidea otherwise known as Toxoglosxa (‘poison
tongue’) owing to the venom apparatus they deploy for immobi-
lising prey [15]. The Conoidea form part of the order Neogaxtropoda in
the sub-class Prosobmnchia of the class Gastropoda of the phylum
Mollusca [11].

Cone snails live throughout the world’s tropical coastal waters
with a steep latitudinal diversity gradient away from the tropics,
extending into cooler regions that include southern California,
northern Gulf of Mexico, Florida and the Carolinas, North Africa,

the Mediterranean, South Africa, Australia, southern Japan and

Extinction risk of marine organisms has attracted little attention
compared to that of terrestrial taxa, with a widely held view that
such risk is inconsequential due to high dispersal ability and large
geographic ranges [1,2] especially when taking reference from the
fossil record [1,3]. These beliefs are particularly prevalent when
considering marine invertebrates, where a decline in abundance of
the important phylum Mollusca has been overshadowed by the
collapse in many exploited vertebrates, especially ﬁnfrsh [4]. This
is primarily due to their relatively minor contribution to human
protein requirements and the generally held belief that molluscs
possess greater resilience to extinction through their perceived
wide distribution and a likelihood of hidden pockets of survivors
[5]. Marine invertebrates in general are seriously under-repre-
sented within the IUCN Red List [6]. Only cuttlefrsh, lobsters and
scleractinian corals have been fully assessed and published [6,7].
Although limited research on the impact of habitat loss and fishing
pressure on marine gastropod molluscs has been undertaken on a
regional scale including for shell fisheries [8,9], there have been no
comprehensive assessments of trends in species abundance,
commercial and environmental impacts and extinction risk to

any genera with a global biogeographical distribution.

China [16]. Distribution varies widely with some species occurring
across the entire tropical Indo-Paciﬁc but others restricted to a
single bay or searnount [11,17].

The genus Conus is taxonomically challenging. Although
morphological characteristics of the shell remain the initial means
of species identiﬁcation [11], more recently, other traits have also
been employed to differentiate among species, in particular the
radular teeth used in the capture of prey, whose shape and
structure not only reﬂects the dietary preferences of the species
[18] but may also be speciﬁc to a single species [19]. Separation of
species through DNA sequence variations provides even greater
reliability, but more recently, character-based DNA barcoding has
been highly effective in distinguishing among closely-related
species [20]. For this assessment we relied upon expertise from
taxonomists in Conus to create a dataset of valid species.

The fossil record indicates that the first Conus appeared in a sea
that covered what is now England and France during the Lower
Eocene around 55 mya [21]. During subsequent radiations the
genus expanded around the globe and by the Holocene had
formed into four biogeographical regions: Indo-Paciﬁc (IP),
Eastern Paciﬁc (EP), Western Atlantic (WA), and Eastern Atlantic
(EA). Although widening of the Atlantic during the Cretaceous
and Cenezoic has today created an impermeable barrier to Conus
crossing the ocean, there have been some migrations in the past, as
witnessed from the fossil record and more recently by C eminent
extant in both the EA and WA and C. chaldaeur, C. ebmeur and C.
termlatur found in both the IP and EP [22].

The majority of the 632 species of Conus assessed (53.6%) occurs
in the infralittoral zone of 5 m deep or less, with most of the
remaining species (27.7%) at 50 m deep or less. However, there
are some species such as C. temmachii that live in deeper parts of the
continental shelf extending to 1,000 m where they may be brought
to the surface as bycatch of demersal ﬁsheries. The bathymetric
ranges of individual species vary considerably with some shallow
water species living within a one or two metre depth range and
some deep-water species being found within a 500 m range or
more [11].

Microhabitats vary by species and most often consist of sand or
mud into which the cone snail may burrow, but may also include
inter-tidal limestone benches (the smooth remains of reef
structures from earlier geological periods when sea levels were
higher [23]) with sand or algal turf, sub-tidal reef platforms with
living and dead corals, or boulders with sandy layers [24]. They
may also be found among coral rubble and occasionally among
mangroves and seagrasses.

Cone snails are generally nocturnal in their feeding habit [25]
and group-speciﬁc in their preference for worms, molluscs or ﬁsh
(Fig. 1) although some species have a mixed diet [26]. The smallest
groupings by diet are the obligate piscivores with around 50
species [11,27], and obligate molluscivores with approximately 80
[28]. The majority of Conus are vermivorous with polychaetes
representing the largest dietary component, that can be the
exclusive source of food for some species [11]. All cone snails use
venom to immobilize their prey. The diversity of venoms
employed by a particular species in the capture of prey is a
reﬂection of the degree of specialisation in its diet [29].

From the earliest civilizations, people have prized cone shells for
their exceptional beauty, with examples discovered among
prehistoric artefacts used for personal adornment extending back
5,000 years [30]. Their striking patterns and wide range of colours
and shades continue to attract collectors today with rare examples
in perfect condition changing hands for thousands of dollars with
common and abundant species traded for cents to a dollar or two
each [12].

Conus Red List Assessment

Over millions of years Conus has evolved a battery of peptide
toxins (conopeptides/conotoxins) for immobilizing prey [31]. The
venom of each species is a cocktail mixed from between 50 and
200 different peptides each of only 10 to 35 amino acids in length
and is generally targeted at voltage-gated or ligand-gated ion
channels [30]. These conopeptides have become a focus for
biomedical research worldwide [14]. Indeed, with the probability
that there are on average over 100 distinct toxins for each species
[30], as a whole, the Conidae can probably synthesize in excess of
50,000 toxins with little, if any, replication [32].

Cone snails are therefore important to: a) biodiversity; they have
evolved into one of the largest of all marine genera, b)
biopharmaceutics; they offer unparalleled opportunities in the
development of novel drugs, and c) economics; their shells provide
income to poor ﬁshing communities through sales to tourists,
traders and a global business in the specimen shell trade.

Habitat loss is considered by many malacologists to be the
primary risk factor facing tropical marine mollusc species (Bouchet
pers. com. 2011) and there is plenty of hard evidence to support
this view. In Queensland, Australia, for example, abundance and
species richness of mollusc assemblages have been shown to be
adversely affected by removal of subtropical mangrove forests,
with population declines of 83% recorded [33]. In San Diego,
Southern California the endemic horn snail, Cerithidiaﬁumta, that
lived along intertidal mudﬂats was last seen in 1935 after pollution
and dredging had driven it to extinction [34]. Where coral cover
has been extensively damaged or degraded through pollution,
sedimentation, coastal development and destructive ﬁshing, as
witnessed throughout much of the tropics, coral-associated
molluscs such as the Conidae are being usurped by bivalve crevice
dwellers [35].

In this paper we report one of the ﬁrst comprehensive extinction
risk assessments of a taxonomically well-resolved marine taxon.
Our research assesses the extinction risk to the global populations
of Conus, examining each species’ distribution, current and
projected threats from disturbance to habitats, pollution, coastal
development, and shell gathering. We have examined where
possible the effects of fragmentation of populations and the likely
impact of demersal ﬁsheries on deeper water species. The
assessment enables us to reappraise whether marine taxa are less
extinction prone than terrestrial. In addition, our aim is to provide
data in support of conservation measures for those species at the
greatest risk of extinction over the short to medium term.

Methods

Red List Assessment

We used the assessment standards and procedures of the
International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red
List of Threatened Species to assess extinction risk to 632 species
of Conus. This is the world’s leading resource for describing the
global conservation status of plants and animals and uses a
standard methodology to classify species into one of nine
categories, together with a codiﬁed set of criteria [36]. The
assessment includes examination of the effects of both ecological
change and commercial exploitation on the subject taxa. Data
derived during the research and discovery process for each species
is compiled to a standard format together with maps, images and
other supporting documentation.

Following taxonomic review, we divided valid species into 12
biogeographical working sets for detailed assessment. A compre-
hensive assessment was not possible for those species where data
was substantially absent. For example, species endemic to areas of
protracted civil unrest such as the Horn of Africa may not have

been researched in the ﬁeld for many years. Coincidentally, these
regions are not generally subject to intensive coastal development,
harbour works and reﬁneries and so may offer a degree of
protection to marine taxa. Similarly, species occurring in deep
water, where recovery is most commonly through ﬁsheries by-
catch, often suffer a paucity of data including extent of distribution
and habitat types. Furthermore, bathymetry data will often rely on
the questionable estimation of ﬁshers. Wherever possible for deep-
water Comm, we have focussed our attention on the level of
demersal ﬁshing in the area, including destructive methods such as
dredging that may seriously affect mollusc assemblages.

Most Conus species, however, occur in shallow water where
impacts such as coastal development, pollution and habitat
destruction can be more easily recorded. Such threats can give
rise to population fragmentation leading to a serious decline in
abundance which may be diﬁ‘icult to quantify until it has become
extreme. However, indicators including market prices for speci-
men shells provide a useful guide to increasing scarcity.
Knowledge voids are common for Conus but where they occur
we have, where possible, used estimation or inference using
suboptimal data permitted under Red List standards [36]. Despite
this, 13.8% of Conus species were found to be so deﬁcient in data
we were unable to make an assessment with any degree of
reliability.

Key indicators of risk

Distribution. A key indicator of potential risk to a species is
the size of its geographical distribution. The Red List standard
assessment uses two measures: Extent of Occurrence (E00) and
Area of Occupancy (AOO). EOO for marine species is the area
within a polygon drawn around the boundary of the species’
range, excluding land areas. This will include areas which may not
be physically occupied by the taxon, e.g. deep water, but which

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org

could contribute to larval dispersal. A00 is the physical area
within the E00 in which the taxon is known to occur. For shallow
water species, this may be calculated from the perimeter of an
island or length of coastline, extended by the width of habitat
calculated from the known or inferred bathymetric range of the
species over the area under review. However, for ‘linear’ habitats
such as rivers and coastlines, IUCN suggests that their standard
habitat width of 2 km should be used in computing A00 [36] and
we have adopted this approach in the assessment for Conur. It
should be noted that both the A00 and the E00 are only of
major signiﬁcance in assessing the level of threat if the species has a
restricted range, and that for most wide-ranging Conus species that
fall outside the parameters of the assessment criteria these range
sizes are not calculated. However, spatial data, derived from range
maps created for every species assessment, were projected using
ArcGIS version 10.1 (Environmental Systems Research Institute)
to generate species richness maps for a) all species and b) only
those species with a range less than the median mapped range size.
All data were standardised onto 10 grid cells and projected to
world cylindrical equal area.

Number of Locations. It is possible that a catastrophic event
could have a profound effect on the population size of some
species. Although marine molluscs are resilient in being able to
endure physical forces such as extreme weather events, small
populations may be extirpated as a result of sudden habitat loss
caused by catastrophic events such as major oil spills. The
‘location’ count indicates the number of areas in which a single
catastrophic event could affect all individuals of the taxon present,
events that may cumulatively drive a species into extinction. The
value of this measure is another key factor in determining the level
of risk a global population faces.

December 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 12 | e83353
Literature search

We conducted a comprehensive search through published
papers and other literature for data relating to Conus species’
populations, depth, distribution, habitats, trade in animals and
shells, use for foodstuﬁ, pharmaceuticals, etc., together with any
conservation measures in place, including indirect conservation as
may be offered by marine protected areas. We sought information
on current and possible future threats, including coastal develop-
ment for tourism, industry or port construction, nutrient loading
from agricultural run-oﬁ, pollution from domestic and industrial
eﬁ‘luent, intensive trawling, siltation from land-based sources,
dredging for shipping channels and mineral extraction. Data on
activities such as these can often only be found in trade
publications, contract award notiﬁcations etc.

We also examined the market in shells to determine ‘collect-
ability’, pricing ﬂuctuations, scarcity and demand. Some shells
with exceptional colour and form will achieve iconic status, and if
they are also rare like C gloriamarix or C. milneedwardri, it adds to
their cachet. Species that live within a highly restricted range,
within a single bay for example, are often at heightened risk from
human activity. This particularly applies to shallow water species
which may be gathered as curios in areas where new beach
tourism projects are being developed or planned. We synthesised
distribution data including observed fragmentation, location
counts, marketability, population declines and threats for each
species to apply one of the nine categories listed below.

Assessment categories

There are three categories of extinction risk: critically Endan-
gered (CR), Endangered (EN) and Vulnerable (VU) that broadly
define ‘extremely high’, ‘very high, or ‘high’ risk of extinction
respectively. In addition, there are two extinct categories, Extinct
(EX) and Extinct in the Wild (EVV), and three other categories:
Near Threatened (NT) for species that will be elevated to a
threatened category in the short term unless the potential risk is
removed; Data Deﬁcient (DD) where there is insufﬁcient data to
determine a category, and Least Concern (LC) where current and
projected population levels indicate the species is not at risk. As
this was a comprehensive assessment, we did not use the category
Not Evaluated (NE), where the species has been recorded but no
assessment has been carried out.

For Conus, the criteria in support of the selected category are
primarily derived from a range of variables based on estimated
population size and/ or level of decline together with species range
size and location count.

Synthesis and pre-publication checks

Following our research and assessment, the results were
reviewed by a panel of fourteen international experts, each with
specialist knowledge of the Conus species within their allotted
biogeographical working sets. The review took the form of a ﬁve
day synthesis workshop with teams comprising leading academics
together with renowned specialists from the commercial sector
with comprehensive ﬁeld knowledge of species’ distribution,
scarcity and threats, and a facilitator experienced in Red List
standards and procedures. This peer-review process conﬁrmed or
modiﬁed ﬁndings of the original assessment authors, and allowed
inclusion of supplementary ﬁeld-based knowledge from the
participating experts. All reports were checked for consistency by
the Mollusc Specialist Group of the IUCN Species Survival

Commission before ﬁnal approval and submission for publication
through the IUCN Red List Unit.

Conus Red List Assessment

Results

The greatest species richness for Conus is in the Philippines and
countries to the south and east towards Papua New Guinea, the
Solomon Islands, New Caledonia and Fiji (Fig. 2A). Species
occurring in the Atlantic including West Africa and the Gulf of
Mexico and Caribbean are fewer in number. However, when very
wide-ranging species are omitted, i.e. those equal to or greater
than the median mapped range size, centres of endemism are
revealed in scattered locations including the Caribbean, the

Marquesas, New Caledonia and the Eastern Atlantic, in particular
Cape Verde, Senegal and Angola (Fig. 2B).

Global threats

Three of 632 Conus species assessed were considered to be
Critically Endangered (CR), 11 Endangered (EN) and 27
Vulnerable (VU), which together represent 6.5% of all global
species (Fig. 3), with a further 26 species (4.1%) categorised as
Near Threatened (NT). Over one in ten of all Conus species is
therefore considered at risk or may become so in the near future.
87 species (13.8%) were categorised as Data Deﬁcient (DD) of
which 75 (86.2%) occur in the Indo-Paciﬁc.

All 14 CR and EN species occur in the waters off Cape Verde
and Senegal, West Africa (Table 1). Of the 27 assessed as VU,
eight are from Cape Verde and Senegal with three from Angola
(Table 1), seven from the Western Atlantic (Table 2), and nine
from the Indian Ocean, including two from Western Australia
(Table 3). Only three threatened species occur east of longitude 60
(Oman to Mascarenes): C. rawaiemis from Western Thailand and
C compressux and C. thwenardemix from Western Australia 7 all VU.
According to this assessment procedure, there are no threatened
species in the Paciﬁc (Fig. 4). Of the 26 Near-Threatened species
(NT), Cape Verde and Senegal are again over-represented with 14
of the 17 species from the Eastern Atlantic. Of the remainder in

this category, ﬁve are from the Western Atlantic, one from the
Western Indian Ocean, and three from the Paciﬁc (Fig. 4).

Analysis by Region

Marine molluscs that are wide-ranging are likely to be more
resilient against threats than those that are range-restricted, with
dispersed populations providing a reservoir for re-colonization in
the event of local extirpations [2]. The Eastern Atlantic species
occupy a limited length of coast with few islands when compared
to the Western Atlantic and, more particularly, the Indo-Paciﬁc. It
is also intersected by large rivers draining the tropical land mass of
Africa which render substantial areas of coastal water unsuitable
for many marine molluscs. Conversely, islands of the tropical
Indo-Paciﬁc and Caribbean contribute substantial areas of shallow
water habitat suitable for taxa such as Conus and do not generally
suffer any signiﬁcant ﬂux of freshwater. Figure 5 shows the
percentage distribution of species’ range sizes within each of the
four oceanic regions. This graphically illustrates that wide-ranging
Conus species, i.e. AOO >2,000 km2, are uncommon within the
Eastern Atlantic compared to the other regions.

Eastern Atlantic. Ninety-eight species of Conus occur along
the Eastern Atlantic seaboard from the Mediterranean and
Morocco south to Namibia, with associated island archipelagos
including the Canaries, Azores, and Cape Verde (plus one: C
ermineux, that also occurs in the Western Atlantic and was included
in that region). There is one species from the island of St Helena, C
jourdani, within this grouping although no live specimens have been
observed and it is categorised as DD. With three CR, 11 EN and
11 VU species, representing 25.5% of the Eastern Atlantic species,
and a further 17 species NT (Table 1), 42.9% of Eastern Atlantic

Conus are considered at risk of extinction or liable to become so.
This exceptional concentration of threatened species is found
nowhere else across the genus’ wide distribution and the
disproportionate contribution of species from Cape Verde and
Senegal demands further explanation.

Cape Verde is home to 8.9% of all Conus species. With 53
species endemic from a total of 56 present in the archipelago,

each restricted to a single island. All three CR species are found in
Cape Verde, C. lugubn'x, C. mordeime, and C. xalreiemzlt, together with
four EN and ﬁve VU (Table 1). There are also 12 NT species.
With 24 species in either a threatened or near-threatened
category, Cape Verde has 45.3% of its Conus diversity at risk
compared to 7.4% for the remainder of the world. Angola and
Senegal contribute the next largest numbers of endemic Conus
species with 22 and 13 respectively, which together with 53 species
endemic to Cape Verde account for 89.8% of all 98 species within
the Eastern Atlantic. Senegal contributes seven EN and three VU
species with Angola contributing three VU (Table 1).

Western Atlantic. We assessed 113 species of Conus from the
Western Atlantic where they occur from the Carolinas and
Bermuda south to Brazil and throughout the Gulf of Mexico and
Caribbean. Species are widely variable in their distribution across
the region. There are six threatened species, all categorised as VU
(see Table 2), representing 5.3% of the total and a further four NT,
together resulting in 8.8% of Conus species within this region
considered at immediate or potential risk.

Indo-Paciﬁc. We assessed 390 species of Conus from the
Indo-Paciflc where they occur across the tropics and subtropics,
from East Africa south to South Africa and north to the Red Sea
and the Persian Gulf and across the whole of the Indian Ocean
and the Western and Central Paciﬁc, south to Australia and New
Zealand, north to Japan, east to French Polynesia and Easter
Island and northeast to Hawaii.

Only nine species were found to be VU. All occur within the
Indian Ocean with six species from the western ﬂank: two from
Oman, one from the southern Red Sea, two from the Mascarenes
and one from South Africa. From the eastern ﬂank there is one
species from Thailand and two from Western Australia. There are
also four NT species including one from Oman with the other

one each from Queensland, the Philippines and the Marquesas.

Eastern Paciﬁc. We assessed 31 species of Conus from the
Eastern Paciﬁc where they occur from Southern California south
along the Paciﬁc coast of Meso-America to Southern Ecuador
including the Galapagos and other island groups of the region.

No species were assessed as threatened or near threatened in the
Eastern Paciﬁc.

Threats

The nature of threats to those species of Conus at risk of
extinction are varied and depend primarily, but not exclusively, on
the proximity and nature of human habitation and development
adjacent to coastlines where the molluscs occur. This alone,
however, will not normally create a scenario for species extinction.
Wide-ranging species are capable of maintaining their viability
through resilience from multiple sub-populations. Although most
threatened Conus species are range-restricted, this is not always the
case: two species from the USA, C. anabathmm and C. xteamxii occur

Table 1. Threatened Conus of the Eastern Atlantic (EA).

along the west coast of Florida where their ranges are substantially
fragmented by shoreline development. However, restricted range,
coupled with shallow water habitat, magniﬁes the impact of
stressors such as coastal development or pollution. Of the 4-1 Conus
species globally assessed as threatened with extinction, 32 (78.0%)
occur within an AOO of 250 km2 and a minimum depth of 5 m or
less. In the Eastern Atlantic, of the 25 threatened species, this rises
to 100%.

Threats to those Conus species assessed within one of the three
threatened categories can be classiﬁed into four causal groups: 1.
pollution, either from proximity to actual or potential petro-
chemical spills, or urban and industrial eﬁ‘luent; 2. disturbance to
habitat from coastal development either resulting from human
population increases, e.g. sea defences, residential and commercial
structures, including aquaculture facilities, and port construction,
or tourism infrastructure. Also included in this group is damage to
habitat caused by damaging and extensive demersal ﬁshing; 3.

combination of causes, for example tourism infrastructure may
also increase shell gathering. Similarly, the proximity of shanty
towns devoid of planning regulations poses an elevated risk of
efﬂuent discharge into the marine environment. Finally habitat
destruction from sand removal, beach nourishment works and
recreational use of the sea may all result in disturbance to local
mollusc populations.

Cape Verde is experiencing a major structural change from a
largely services and ﬁsheries based economy supported by
development aid and remittances from its diaspora to one of
beach tourism [37]. This is accompanied by a myriad of threats
from road and resort construction, unlawful removal of beach
sand for cement [38] and casual shell gathering by tourists. All
three CR species occur in Cape Verde where their populations are
already reduced. C. lugubn'r and C. mordeime live in areas where
habitat has already been lost to development and C. ralreiermlr
which is restricted to a single bay has had observable declines in
population since a harbour was constructed. Each is found in an
area along a shallow coastal strip of less than 11 km in length.
Harbour expansion and the accidental discharge of engine fuel
increase the pressures on small, range-restricted Conus populations
such as C. ﬁmanderi, C. fontonae and C. regonae. With so many Conus
species occupying highly restricted ranges within the archipelago,
modest threats such as these could have a profound impact.

Around the Dakar peninsula, Senegal, it has been observed that
species restricted to its highly polluted coastal waters are showing a
marked decline in abundance coupled with an overall diminution
of shell size including C. echinophilur, C. lyibn'dur, C. mercator and C.
uny’arciamr. In common with many maritime cities in developing
countries, Dakar suffers from a burgeoning population with largely
inadequate waste-processing infrastructure. South in Angola, Conus
species categorised as at risk face similar threats to those in
Senegal.

In the Western Atlantic some disturbance to Conus can be traced
to human migration to the Florida coast. Tourism and retirement
have driven large-scale construction projects for condominiums
and other coastal infrastructure leading to signiﬁcant loss of
habitat for C. anabathmm and C. rteamrii. Tourism also represents
the underlying risk to the vulnerable species C. hennequini in
Martinique and C. hierogb/phur in Aruba. Shell collecting in the
Bahamas threaten C. richardbinghami. General coastal development
in Bahia, Brazil threatens C. keno/mi where it occurs only oﬁ“ two
small islands. The Venezuelan government has voiced plans for
substantial development on the islands of Los Roques which will
place the shallow water species, C. dzgﬁi at risk.

The Conus species of the Indo-Paciﬁc are at less risk. In the

north-westem Indian Ocean, the Persian Gulf, the southern Red
Sea including the Gulf of Aden and the Horn of Africa, civil wars,

poverty, piracy and the security situation offer some degree of
protection from coastal development. However, there are still
concerns from oil spillage in the region and two scarce species
from Oman, C. ardiriaceur and C. mlvilli together with C. cuvieri
from Djibouti are categorised as VU. In Southern Natal and the
Mascarene islands of Mauritius and Reunion respectively, C.
immelmam' and C. julii, have both declined in numbers almost
certainly from over-collecting, with C. jeannuzrtini also from
Reunion being subject to intensive trawling in its deep-water
habitat.

In the Eastern Indian Ocean, C. rawaimrir occurs only in an area
estimated at less than 35 km2 in a single location oﬁ“ the western
shores of Thailand in a region zoned for tourism. In Western
Australia, an extreme localized warm-water event in 2011 from La
Niﬁa, in the region around Geraldton to Shark Bay including the
Abrolhos Islands, resulted in a catastrophic decline of marine
molluscs including Conidae. C. compmrur, a restricted range species,
possibly suffered a 50% decline in abundance. Also in Western
Australia, C. t/wvmardenrzlr, already rare, is subject to a range of
threats including a large oil installation, tourism and dredging.

Other Red List categories

The results for the three threatened categories paint an
incomplete picture. There are also 87 species assessed to be Data
Deﬁcient and 26 as Near Threatened, together representing
17.9% of the global diversity. Many of the Data Deﬁcient species
are considered to be scarce in the wild even though the causes and
extent of the threats they face cannot yet be determined with
sufﬁcient accuracy. Twice as many of the 87 DD species, (39.1%)
occur only at depths of 50 m or more, i.e. below gleaning, scuba,
and (many) artisanal ﬁshing gears, compared to 19.4% for the
remaining 545 species globally. Specimens may be brought to the
surface from these depths as by-catch from ﬁsheries. However,
demersal gear such as dredges may also contribute substantially to
the endangerment of the species recovered through destruction of
their habitat, especially for those that are also of restricted range.
Occurrence in deep water does not automatically result in a DD
categorisation. Despite paucity of data, taxa with a known
distribution greater than 2,000 km2 but with no known threat
would normally be assessed as Least Concern. At the other
extreme, there are also a number of DD species where there is an
almost total absence of recent sightings but extinction cannot be
proven, i.e. there is reasonable doubt that the last individual has
died [39]. This is exempliﬁed by species such as C. jourdcmi from St
Helena which is only known from ‘dead’ shells washed onto the
beach in one small bay; C. bellulur and C. luteur which have not

the 36.8% of DD species that are wider-ranging (AOO
>2,000 km2) are based on infrequent sightings. It would therefore
be reasonable to suppose that a substantial proportion of the DD
species are potential candidates for listing as threatened.

DD species are overwhelmingly found in the Indo-Paciﬁc.
There are three in the Eastern Atlantic, eight in the Western
Atlantic, 75 in the Indo-Paciﬁc and one in the Eastern Paciﬁc.

Outside the Indo-Paciﬁc there is just a single species with a known
AOO of more than 2,000 km2.

Discussion

It is widely believed that extinction risk in the sea is less likely
than in the terrestrial environment and that this is supported by
the fossil record [2,3]. This view is based largely on perceived high
fecundity, greater dispersal ability and geographic range size [40].
With 6.5% of Conus species at risk globally this would appear to
follow this perception, however, in regions offering reduced
dispersal opportunity, such as the whole of the Eastern Atlantic,
25.5% of species are threatened. Cone snails here have a similar
level of extinction risk to species in well-assessed terrestrial taxa,
such as freshwater invertebrates (34% of 7,784 species assessed at
risk), lepidoptera (from 8.5% of butterﬂies in Europe to 17% in the
US. at risk), European terrestrial molluscs (20% at risk) [41,42]
and bryophyte ﬂora from the Canaries (21% at risk) [43].
Contributing to the pattern seen, many cone snails have limited
dispersal ability, small geographic ranges and/ or are rare. The
level of extinction risk is similar in other well assessed marine taxa,
including corals (27% of species at risk) [7,44] and scombrid and
billflsh (11% of 61 species at risk) [45]. Given the rapid escalation
of threats to the marine environment [46], if the pattern seen in

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org

these groups is typical of marine species generally, then there is a
high risk that extinctions will soon become common in the sea, just
as they now are on land.

Our global assessment of the conservation status of all 632 cone
snails shows that three-quarters (75.6%) of species are classiﬁed as
Least Concern under IUCN Red List standards. However,
beneath this relatively optimistic result lies a picture of substantial
regional variations with indicators signalling wider concerns. In
the Eastern Atlantic along the shores of Senegal, Cape Verde and
Angola, species restricted in their range and subject to the effects
of industrialisation and urbanisation face an elevated risk of
extinction. Endemism for marine species occurs most commonly
in isolated island groups where the original dispersal was assisted
by a pelagic larval stage or by transport on rafting matter [47].
Endemics may also be found where there may be non-reversing
currents transporting water away from the tropics towards higher
latitudes [40]. All Cape Verde endemic Conus have a non-
planktonic larval stage having lost the ability during speciation to
feed during larval dispersal [48]. This conforms to the hypothesis
that non-planktonic, i.e. lecithotrophic, species of Conus commonly
originate from planktotrophic species [49]. All three species
assessed as Critically Endangered occur in the waters 011“ Cape
Verde where they are exposed to habitat degraded through coastal
development primarily driven by tourism. Similarly, of the 11
Endangered species, four are found in Cape Verde with the
remaining seven occurring off the coast of Senegal, in particular
the Dakar peninsula, where high levels of pollution from industrial
and residential effluent is thought to be the driver of declining
abundance and observable reductions in body size. A further 11
species (40.7%) of the 27 assessed as Vulnerable occur in Cape
Verde, Senegal and Angola, making West Africa home to 61% of

December 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 12 | e83353
the 41 Conus species threatened with extinction. Of the remaining
16 species categorised as Vulnerable, seven are found in the
Western Atlantic where they are primarily exposed to coastal
development, tourism and shell collecting. The remaining nine
occur in the Indian Ocean where petrochemicals, shell-collecting
and elevated sea-surface temperatures represent the principal
causes of decline.

Threats

Overﬁshing. The effect of overﬁshing on the abundance of
ﬁsh stocks has been extensively reported in both the scientiﬁc and
general press over many years [50,51]. However, threats to
invertebrates from ﬁshing are seldom equated with extinction,
especially marine molluscs. Although extremely unusual, near-
extinctions in this group have occurred in the recent past; for
example in the white abalone Haliotux sonmeni from southern
California and Baja California by the mid-1990s had been ﬁshed
to the edge of extinction [52]. Once counted in the millions there
are now probably less than 1,600 individuals remaining.

Amongst marine molluscs, most species are sought by shell
collectors [12]. Although this does not threaten the survival of the
vast majority of molluscs, shell collecting has undoubtedly caused
the decline and endangerment of some species, particularly
‘trophy’ shells. Throughout the Indo-Paciﬁc, the spectacular giant
triton (Charmia tn'tomlv), has been extensively ﬁshed and in many
areas has been extirpated [53]. Similarly, although primarily
removed for its adductor muscles, the giant clam (Tn'dama gigax) the
largest of all bivalve molluscs, has met the same fate [54]. In
Zanzibar, East Africa, the cowries Cypmea tzgn's, C hixtn'o and C. Mac
were found to be up to 18 times less abundant in exploited tourist
areas [8]. We identiﬁed three rare species of Conus threatened by
shell collecting: C richardbinghami from the Bahamas and C.
immelmam' and C. julii from the Mascarenes. Taxa already facing
pressures from factors such as pollution may be pushed further
towards extinction by gathering for shells, yet warning indicators
such as sudden price inﬂation on the shell market may not alone
warrant inclusion to a threatened category.

Bioprospecting. Conus is exceptionally important to biomed-
ical science, although there is dispute about the number of animals
taken for their bioactive compounds. To protect their intellectual
property, pharmaceutical companies are silent on the issue, but
researchers are adamant that volumes are negligible. In their
dialogue in Science Chivian et al. (2003; 2004) raised important
concerns about the quantity of cone snails taken from the wild,
indicating that thousands were then collected to satisfy research
demands [55,56]. This was forcefully rebutted by Duda et al.
(2004) who reviewed recent conotoxin research from which they
determined that a maximum of 20 research groups were working
on Conus toxins at that time, and that any single characterisation
required fewer than 21 animals to be sacriﬁced [57]. Regardless of
where the true determinant lies, balancing the legitimate needs of
medical research without further compromising natural resources
is essential. Fortunately, alternative, more sustainable options are
now available including milking venom without killing the animal
[58], polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing of DNA
fragments that requires just one specimen [59] and more recently
digital marine bioprospecting using massive parallel deep
sequencing of transcriptomes that requires only minute samples
of bioactive material [60].

Habitat loss. It has been shown that habit loss leads to
declines in species richness, reduced biomass and loss of
complexity [61,62], often accompanied by colonisation by species
that inhibit recovery [63]. Virtually all of the world’s ‘trawlable’
area of continental shelf has already been altered, and about half

PLOS ONE | www.p|osone.org

Conus Red List Assessment

the area of all the continental shelves is hit by trawls every year
[64], changing the structure and function of habitats, destroying
assemblages and resulting in homogenisation of the seabed [65].
Of 133 marine species that have been recorded as having gone
extinct either regionally or globally, 37% were attributed entirely
or in part to habitat loss [66]. Extinctions of marine gastropod
molluscs from loss of habitat are set to continue and include the
horn snail Ceﬁthidea ﬁmata from southern California last seen in
1935, the eelgrass limpet Lottia alveux alveux from the northwest
USA last collected in 1929, and from the 19th century the rocky
shore limpet ‘Colirella’ edmitchelli also from southern California and
the periwinkle Littormia ﬂammea from China; all driven to
extinction through loss of habitat from anthropogenic causes,
with the possible exception of the eelgrass limpet that lost its
habitat from a slime mould that may have been introduced from
ships’ ballast [2,34].

Our assessment found that with the exception of three species
made vulnerable by shell collecting (see above), all 38 other Conus
species threatened with extinction are impacted to some degree by
habitat loss, either directly from coastal and port development or
indirectly from pollution or from human exacerbated natural
occurrences such as El Niﬁo/ La NiﬁaiSouthem Oscillation
(ENSO) warm-water events (Fig. 6).

Red List comparatives

Our Conus assessment is the ﬁrst global study for the IUCN Red
List for any marine gastropod mollusc genus and one of the few for
marine invertebrates. Other marine invertebrates that have been
the subject of a global assessment include 845 reef-building corals,
247 lobsters and 195 cuttleﬁshes [44]. Data Deﬁciency is a
common thread throughout each of these studies with 17%, 35%
and 76% of species for each respective grouping [44] compared to
14% for Conus. Preliminary results available for oceanic squid show
that 57% of this group are of Least Concern with the remaining
43% Data Deﬁcient. As with the data deﬁcient cone snails, many
of these cephalopods are deep-water species that have only been
captured on a few occasions [44].

Of the 845 corals that have been globally assessed 27.3% fall
into a threatened category with a further 20.8% near threatened,
although prior to the massive bleaching event of 1998 it has been
estimated that 95.3% of non-DD species would have been
categorised as Least Concern [7]. The exceptional ENSO event
which resulted in this bleaching largely devalues any post-event
comparison, although it has been shown that La Niﬁa can impact
some mollusc assemblages through stress, changes in productivity
and availability of dietary preferences [67]. In Australia, the La
Niﬁa event of 2010-11 gave the highest monthly Southern
Oscillation Index values on record accompanied by elevated sea-
surface temperatures in Western Australia [68]. In the region
around Geraldton to Shark Bay including the Abrolhos Islands,
this coincided with an estimated 50% mortality in molluscs that
included Conus comprexsux (H. Morrison pers. com. 2011).
Scleractinian corals and molluscs, including Conus, also share the
threat of ocean acidiﬁcation with the prospect of arrested
development in their aragonite-forming structures [69,70]. Of all
the threats faced by these fauna this is the most intractable and one
that could even determine their continued existence.

For freshwater molluscs, Red List assessments have been
completed for 1,500 of the 5,000 described species [6,42]. Results
show that out of 7,784 freshwater invertebrates assessed to date,
gastropods are the most threatened group with a threat range of
33% (if no DD species are threatened) to 68% (if all DD species
are threatened) [42]. In common with Conus, the threatened

December 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 12 | e83353
species include range-restricted habitat specialists that are partic-
ularly at risk from loss of habitat and pollution.

Further Research and Conservation Priorities

As a global assessment for conservation has not been
undertaken on any other marine gastropod it is not possible to
explore relationships between different gastropod genera to
identify commonality of risks. Further research is urgently needed
to address this issue.

Data Deﬁcient Conus species can normally be characterised by
minimal sightings and a lack of data on distribution. This may
result from their bathymetric proﬁle (39% of DD species occur
only at 50 m or more) and/ or genuine rarity. However, DD
species share a common trait with those categorised as threatened
in having a higher percentage with restricted range than those
from the general population, with the implication that there could
be a signiﬁcant proportion of DD species at risk. Bearing the title
‘Data Deﬁcient’ or ‘Near Threatened’ places these 113 species
jointly away from the spotlight afforded the 4-1 species in the three
threatened categories. However, with the potential to double the
number of species at risk it is essential that the taxa that make up
these categories should not be ignored but instead beneﬁt from
further research into their true status.

One of the primary sources of information on species
distribution, habitats, populations and threats for our Red List
assessment has been the specimen shell trade. In many parts of the
developing world, trade in shells provides valuable additional
revenue to some of the poorest families living along tropical
coastlines. Research is needed to assess the threat from rare shell
collecting towards mollusc population decline to determine what
measures should be taken to enable this activity to continue
sustainably while at the same time allowing for protection of
vulnerable species.

The need to identify conservation strategies for all species at risk
is compelling, although for developing nations, snail conservation
is unlikely to become a driver for environmental improvements. In
the absence of in situ conservation measures, captive breeding
programmes may ultimately be necessary, such as those under-
taken for tree snails of the genus Partula from the Paciﬁc Islands
[71]. At present, except possibly for species such a C. penmweur and
C. textile that emerge as mature veligers, this is not a viable option,
as the complexity of plankton essential for developing larvae
cannot be easily replicated [28].

Over half (53.6%) of all Conus species occur at depths of 5 m or
less where they are susceptible to gleaning, and nearly three-
quarters (74.5%) occur at or above recreational SCUBA diving
depths of 30 m or less. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) offer one
of the few sanctuaries, but regional authorities need encourage-
ment to strengthen enforcement and to erect prominent signage
against shell gathering within MPAs.

Conus Red List Assessment

Cape Verde presents a special case in Conus conservation. With
45.3% of its species at risk there is a strong argument for legislating
against export of both animals and shells, and with manageable
borders the country is ideally suited to export controls. This small
archipelago also signals a warning to other nations developing
their coastal infrastructure: new roads bring visitors to areas
previously protected by their isolation, and illegal sand removal for
construction from beaches and shallow water of the littoral zone
[72] pose a constant threat to habitat. Regional authorities should
be required to undertake environmental impact assessments that
take account of these issues when planning new developments.

The toxins that make Conus so successful are generally unique to
each species [59] and any extinction in the genus could in turn
deprive science of a potential pharmacological resource. The
extraordinary number of species and the global distribution of
these tropical snails make them an important contributor to
marine biodiversity, and with the appeal of their shells they help
support some of the world’s poorest people.

Finally, there exists a well-defmed community of cone snail
aﬁcionados who together are highly inﬂuential in the trade in cone
shells. This includes leading academics as well as collectors and
dealers. A positive first step from our Red Listng is that following
a preliminary presentation of our ﬁndings at their international
convention, a core of members has been motivated to explore a
voluntary embargo in trade of critically endangered species and to
consider this also for other Conus species at risk [73].
